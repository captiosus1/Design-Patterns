# Design Patterns Journey

Welcome to my Design Patterns Journey! This repository documents my exploration and implementation of various design patterns in Java, inspired by the work of [iluwatar/java-design-patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/tree/master).

## Introduction

In software engineering, design patterns are proven solutions to common design problems. They help developers create more maintainable and scalable code. Throughout this journey, I will implement various design patterns, provide examples, and share my insights on each pattern's practical applications.

## Design Patterns Overview

This repository covers the following categories of design patterns:

- **Creational Patterns**: Patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable for the situation.
- **Structural Patterns**: Patterns that deal with object composition, creating relationships between objects to form larger structures.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Patterns that focus on communication between objects, defining how objects interact and cooperate.

## Implemented Patterns

Here is a list of design patterns that I have implemented:

- **Singleton Pattern**
  - Description: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
  - Implementation: `src/singleton`

## Usage

To use the implemented design patterns, clone this repository and navigate to the corresponding pattern's source file. Each implementation includes a main method that demonstrates how to use the pattern. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/captiosus1/DesignPatterns.git
cd DesignPatterns/src/singleton
javac Singleton.java
java Singleton
